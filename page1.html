  <h1>What Are Cookies?</h1>
  <p>In web development, a <strong>cookie</strong> is a small text file stored in a user's browser by a website. It allows websites to remember information about a user's visit, such as preferences, login status, or items in a shopping cart.</p>

  <h2>Why Cookies Exist</h2>
  <p>HTTP—the protocol websites use—is stateless. This means the server doesn’t "remember" anything about a user's previous visits. Cookies solve this by storing data locally and allowing continuity between sessions.</p>

  <h2>Key Properties of Cookies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Name & Value:</strong> Every cookie stores data as a key-value pair.</li>
    <li><strong>Expiration:</strong> Cookies can be set to expire after a time period.</li>
    <li><strong>Domain & Path:</strong> These control where cookies are valid.</li>
    <li><strong>Secure & HttpOnly:</strong> Flags that control access and security.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Types of Cookies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> Temporary, deleted when the browser is closed.</li>
    <li><strong>Persistent Cookies:</strong> Stay stored even after the browser is closed.</li>
    <li><strong>First-party Cookies:</strong> Set by the site you’re visiting.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-party Cookies:</strong> Set by domains other than the one you’re visiting (typically advertisers).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Real-World Example</h2>
  <p>When you log into Gmail and stay logged in even after closing your browser, a persistent cookie remembers your session. If you use a shopping site like Amazon, your cart remains saved due to cookies.</p>
