      <h1>What Are Cookies?</h1>

      <p><strong>Cookies</strong> are small text files that websites store on your device through your web browser. They allow websites to remember information about your visit, such as login status, preferences, or shopping cart items.</p>
      <h2>History of Cookies</h2>
      <p>Cookies were invented in <strong>1994</strong> by <strong>Lou Montulli</strong>, a programmer working for Netscape Communications. The original goal was to enable online shopping carts to remember the items users had selected — a major technical challenge at the time due to the stateless nature of HTTP.</p>
      <p>Montulli’s idea was to allow a website to store a small piece of data in the user’s browser that could be retrieved on later visits. This enabled a persistent memory of a user's actions without requiring constant server-side sessions.</p>
      <p>Cookies quickly became a standard part of the web and were formally described in <strong>RFC 2109</strong> and later updated by RFC 6265. Despite being initially created for convenience, their ability to store user activity has led to wide debate about privacy and data control.</p>

      <h2>How Do Cookies Work?</h2>
      <p>When you visit a website, the server sends a cookie to your browser, which stores it locally. On your next visit, your browser sends the cookie back to the server, allowing the site to remember you.</p>

      <h2>Types of Cookies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> Deleted when the browser is closed.</li>
        <li><strong>Persistent Cookies:</strong> Remain until they expire or are manually deleted.</li>
        <li><strong>First-Party Cookies:</strong> Set by the site you're visiting.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Cookies:</strong> Set by external services (e.g., advertisers).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Are Cookies Important?</h2>
      <p>Cookies are essential for modern web functionality. Without them, websites wouldn’t be able to remember your progress, preferences, or shopping cart across sessions.</p>
